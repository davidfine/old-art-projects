A ring of 16 motion controlled propane flame effects. 
Infrared range sensors go into voltage comparators which go into BS24 boards which trigger relays. 
The Basic Stamp lacked ADC you see...
The original version used entirely discreet components, the microcontroller version that went to
playa in 2006 was started with maybe not enough time to not be crazy stressful.

If arduinos were around at the time I'd have used those. Instead it used 4 seperate basic stamp 
relay boards I designed. 

I actually re-wrote it for Arduino several years later, but that code has never been used. I expect it would work pretty well.
